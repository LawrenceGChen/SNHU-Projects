# SNHU-Projects

    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
   
    This project allows a user to track sales at the Corner Grocer. Before the project, their system generated text records throughout the day as items were sold. By using those text records as input, Corner Grocer can utilize this program to see which items are purchased most often, both in numerical and graphical form.
    
    What did you do particularly well?
    
    Through the use of text formatting available in C++, I ensured that the histograph of the data was aligned in such a way that you could tell at a glance which items were more popular, rather than having to count the individual characters.
    
    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

    One place I could enhance this code is through the use of inline comments. It is important to have code that is maintainable by myself and others, and once I get to a point where I am more knowledgable in the realm of coding, I need to make sure I can come back to older projects and still understand the code even if it is written poorly or non-optimally.
    
    Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

    The most challenging piece of code to write was probably the text formatting for the output. In general, I have always found text formatting in programming to be of a more obtuse syntax than most other parts, requiring specific tags or commands for the desired output. I primarily utilized Stack Exchange and past questions and answers to help find and learn the correct code in order to achieve the desired result.
    
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

    This is the first time I have worked with C++, and although it is still a relatively basic level of understanding, it is important to be fluent in multiple programming languages in order to be able to adapt to whatever company I may work for in the future.
    
    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

    Unfortunately, the program in its current state is not very well maintainable. I still need to work on writing comments while writing my implementation files in order to ensure readability in the future. The way the program reads the input and adds new items to the output ensures that if the Corner Grocer were to ever start to offer new produce items, there would not be any concern with regards to tracking those sales.
